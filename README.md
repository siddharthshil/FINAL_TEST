# FINAL_TEST
AI IN ENTERPRISE
IN THIS PROJECT WE HAVE WORKED ON A DATASET WHICH IS BASED ON FISH.
WITH THE HELP OF JUPYTER NOTEBOOK I HAVE A IMPLEMENTED RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFIER MODEL.
WE ALSO HAVE A FRONTED FOR THIS MODEL WHERE IT PREDICTS THE SPECIES OF THE FISH ON THE BASIS OF LENGHT, WIDTH AND WEIGHT.
RUNNING THE FLASK APP.PY WE GET A URL WHICH SHOWS THE DEMO.
I HAVE UPLOADED ALL THE FILES IN THE GITHUB IN A NEW REPOSITORY.
IN THE HEROKU I CREATED A NEW APP AND CONNECTED THE GITHUB REPOSITORY WITH IT.
AND FINALLY DEPLOY IT.
AFTER THE SUCCESSFUL BUILD LOG, YOU CAN COPY THE URL AND PASTE IT INTO NEW BROWSER TO PERFORM PREDICTIONS.
THANK YOU
